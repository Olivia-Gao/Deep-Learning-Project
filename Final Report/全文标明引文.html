Photovoltaic (PV) systems, which convert sunlight</p><p>into electricity using solar cells, are widely used due to their sustainability, low maintenance costs, and ease of installation. However, PV panels often suffer from defects such as cracks, hot spots, and shading, which can significantly reduce energy conversion efficiency and, if left undetected, lead to system failure. To address this, the project proposes a deep learning classification model that combines Inception modules, Attention mechanisms, and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to detect solar panel defects from thermal infrared images. The model is trained and evaluated on a public dataset containing 5,352 thermal images of solar panels, with labels indicating the presence or absence of thermal defects. Three data partitioning strategies (80:10:10,70:20:10, and 60:20:20) are applied to assess model performance under different validation conditions. Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Loss, Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), Specificity, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 91.56%, an AUC of 0.9677, and an F1-Score of 95.33%. Furthermore, a user-friendly graphical interface has been developed to allow users to upload thermal images and receive instant classification results. This system enhances defect detection efficiency, supports preventive maintenance, extends panel lifespan, and reduces long-term operational costs in solar energy systems.</p><p>Keywords: CNN, Solar Cell, Deep Learning, Thermal image, Inception, Attention</p><p>Mechanism, BiLSTM, Explainable AI</p><p>xii</p><p>Abbreviations</p><p>Acc Accuracy</p><p>AUC Area Under the ROC Curve</p><p>Attention Attention Mechanism</p><p>BiLSTM Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory</p><p>BS Batch Size</p><p>CNN Convolutional Neural Network</p><p>FN False Negative FP False Positive</p><p>F1 F1-Score</p><p>GAP Global Average Pooling GPU Graphic Processing Unit</p><p>HF Horizontal Flip HS Height Shift</p><p>IR Infrared</p><p>Inception Inception Module L2 L2 Regularization</p><p>LR Learning Rate</p><p>MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging</p><p>PV Photovoltaic</p><p>Prec Precision</p><p>ReLU Rectified Linear Unit</p><p>Rec Recall</p><p>ROC Receiver Operating Characteristic</p><p>xiii</p><p>RR Rotation Range</p><p>Spec Specificity</p><p>SR Shear Range TN True Negative TP True Positive WS Width Shift</p><p>XAI Explainable Artificial Intelligence</p><p>XML Extensible Markup Language</p><p>ZR Zoom Range</p><p>xiv</p><p>Glossary</p><p><em class='similar'>Convolutional Neural Network </em><em class='similar'>(CNN):</em><em class='similar'> A type of deep neural network commonly used in image processing and computer vision tasks.</em><em class='similar'> CNNs are designed </em>to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images by using convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.</p><p><em class='similar'>Solar Cell:</em><em class='similar'> A semiconductor device that converts light energy directly into electrical energy through the photovoltaic effect.</em><em class='similar'> Solar cells are the fundamental building blocks of photovoltaic systems,</em> which are used for solar power generation.</p><p><em class='similar'>Deep Learning:</em><em class='similar'> A subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with many layers </em><em class='similar'>(hence "deep")</em>.

Additionally, the increasing demand for electricity due to factors such as a growing population necessities effort to move away from conventional methods of energy production [1]. There is a kind of technology called solar photovoltaic cells which can generate electricity by absorbing sunlight and converting light energy into an electric current. Solar energy is mainly harvested by photovoltaic plants which have numerous advantages, including extended lifespan, sustainability, low-noise performance, and cleanliness [2]. Solar cells can be installed in series or parallel to form photovoltaic (PV) panels. PV panels are not only environmentally friendly but also relatively easy to install and deploy [3].</p><p>1.1.1 Solar Cell Structure</p><p>A solar cell is a device that harnesses the photovoltaic <em class='similar'>effect to directly transform light energy into electrical energy </em><em class='similar'>[4].</em><em class='similar'> Here is the descriptions of the solar cell structure and figure 1 shows the basic structure of a solar cell.</em></p><p>1.

                    <p><p>1.1.2 Solar Cell Applications</p><p>Solar panels play a crucial role in the global energy system, not only promoting the development of renewable energy but also being widely applied in various fields. In residential applications, household devices can directly use electricity generated by solar power. For example, solar water heaters can provide hot water for households, and installing photovoltaic cells on the roof can store electricity and reduce energy costs. Additionally, in commercial applications, many businesses and industrial parks have installed large-scale solar power stations to reduce their carbon footprint and operational costs. Besides, solar energy is also widely used in remote areas. For example, schools, community centers, and clinics in remote regions can install solar panels to generate and utilize electricity [5]. Figure 2 shows some examples of different solar cell applications.</p><p>Figure 2. Examples of Different Solar Cell Applications</p><p>1.1.3 Solar Cell Defects</p><p>PV panels have yet to achieve a perfect conversion rate of the incident solar energy [3]. In addition, because some solar cell defects will occur during manufacturing, installation, throughout their operational lifetime and so on. These defects can negatively impact the efficiency and performance of the solar panels. Here are the common types of solar cell defects: for example, cracks usually appear as visible lines or fractures on the surface of solar panels, which can obstruct the internal current flow and consequently reduce efficiency. In addition, hot spots are localized overheating phenomena on solar panels. Prolonged presence of hot spots may cause permanent damage to the panels and even pose a fire hazard. Additionally, shading refers to objects such as branches, dust, dirt, or snow covering the surface of a solar panel, leading to a decrease in the output power of the shaded cells. In severe cases, it may result in the formation of hot spots. Not only these listed defects, there are many defects which can cause a variety of issues ranging from minor decreases in efficiency to complete failure of solar panels. The best way to ensure the long-term stable and efficient operation of a solar energy system is to identify and address these issues in a timely manner.</p><p>1.1.4 Detection Methods Overview</p><p>With the rapid development of the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry, ensuring the efficient operation of solar panels is crucial for improving energy conversion efficiency and reducing maintenance costs. However, solar cell defect detection is challenging due to issues <em class='similar'>such as interference from complex backgrounds and the diversity in shape of the same class of defects in solar cells </em>[6]. Various methods have been used for defect detection in solar panels, including some traditional detection techniques and the increasingly adopted thermal imaging technology in recent years.</p><p>The traditional detection methods mainly include the manual inspection and visible light imaging detection. Manual inspection involves visually examining solar panels for visible damage or using handheld devices for localized testing to detect abnormalities in panel voltage, current, or surface temperature. Therefore, when dealing with a large number of solar panels, manual inspection is highly inefficient and time-consuming. Moreover, the results heavily depend on the experience of the operator, which may make mistakes in judgment. Additionally, it is difficult to detect some hidden defects. Visible light imaging</p><p>detection mainly relies on regular cameras or drones to capture the surface of solar panels,</p><p>and defects are identified through image analysis. Therefore, it is only suitable for surface defects and is affected by weather and lighting conditions.</p><p>To address the shortcomings of traditional detection methods, thermal imaging technology has become an important tool for solar panel inspection in recent years. Thermal imaging is a method that measures an object&#39;s temperature without physical contact or causing any damage [7]. Thermal imaging can accurately detect hot spots, microcracks, identify electrical faults, and detect shading effects when inspecting solar panels. It also enables non-contact, long-distance inspection and can adapt to complex environments. In recent years, with the advancements in deep learning technology, thermal imaging detection can be combined with machine learning algorithms to achieve automated fault recognition. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with thermal imaging, these anomalies can be easily detected and inferred in a contactless and non-invasive manner. Additionally, the ability to perform efficient and scalable operations on large datasets has further driven the widespread use of thermal imaging with machine learning techniques [7]. This can further improve detection accuracy, providing more intelligent maintenance solutions for the solar photovoltaic industry, reducing energy loss, and enhancing overall power generation efficiency.</p><p>1.1.5 Convolution Neural Network Overview</p><p>Since Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has the advantage of automatically extracting features without human intervention, it has become the most widely used model [8]. In addition, CNN has the ability to learn highly abstract features and can efficiently recognize objects, which further highlights its superiority [9]. The weight sharing feature of CNN can reduce training time and the number of training parameters, avoid model overfitting, and also improve generalization ability [10]. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and classification tasks, particularly suited for processing image data with spatial structural features. Moreover, CNNs have demonstrated unique advantages in thermal image defect detection. This is because thermal images primarily reflect the thermal characteristics of a target through pixel temperature distribution, where defect areas typically exhibit temperature patterns that are significantly different from</p><p>surrounding regions. These local spatial differences are exactly the kind of features that CNNs are adept at capturing. Additionally, CNNs can automatically extract multi-level image features through convolution operations, thereby enabling more effective learning of discriminative features from temperature distributions.</p><p><em class='similar'>A Convolutional Neural Network </em><em class='similar'>(CNN)</em> typically begins with an input layer,<em class='similar'> followed by key components such as convolutional layers,</em><em class='similar'> pooling layers,</em><em class='similar'> and fully connected layers.</em> This architecture enables the step-by-step processing of raw image data, allowing for the effective extraction of important features and supporting accurate classification or prediction decisions [11].

This dataset has 5,352 thermal images of solar cells and the labels are ‘thermal defect’ which mains if the XML file include ‘thermal defect’ the cells is defected. The dataset will be divided into training, validation, and test sets using three different partition ratios. The first ratio is 80% for training,10% for validation, and 10% for testing. The second ratio is 70% for training,20% for validation, and 10% for testing. The third ratio is 60% for training,20% for validation, and 20% for testing. It is necessary for each training, validation, and test set to contain both defect and no-defect types. The results will then be compared.</p><p>This project aims to develop an Inception-Attention-BiLSTM model (IABiLSTM-NET), with hyperparameter adjustments such as batch size, learning rate, dropout rate etc. In addition, the evaluation of the model will include metrics such as Accuracy and Loss.

Through advanced data analysis and early detection, these studies aim to improve the maintenance of solar panels, extend their lifespan, and enhance overall energy</p><p>efficiency, contributing to the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of solar energy systems.</p><p>Koshy et al.[12] proposed a deep learning techniques, including ResNet and custom CNNs, achieving an average prediction accuracy of 94% and 12 parameters were classified with 86% accuracy. However, the limitations of the model are that the data is unbalanced and the computational resource is limited. Wang et al.[13] proposed an improved Mask R-CNN, achieving Precision of 75.04%, Recall of 97.4% and mAP of 82.45% improving 13.4% precision,7.9% recall and 10.81% mAP from Mask R-CNN. But it lacks validation in real-world engineering environments. Haidari et at.[14] proposed a modified VGG16 used for fault classification in a photovoltaic module, achieving a total accuracy of 0.98 and performance good in validation set. The drawback of this model is that the training data includes images with varying distances and resolutions. Dunderdale et al.[15] proposed a method based on deep learning and features to detect and classify defective photovoltaic modules using thermal infrared images. They used VGG-16, MobileNet and SVM in the research and achieve 91.2% of accuracy and can differentiate between defects with up to 89.5% of accuracy. But the dataset used in this project is small. Shaik et al.[2] proposed a novel deep learning architecture for the segmentation of solar plant aerial images, along with a transfer learning-based model for classifying solar panel damage by U-Net and VGG-19. Yousif and Al-Milaji [16] proposed an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both handcrafted and automatically extracted features to enhance the classification accuracy of photovoltaic (PV) images and achieve achieved an overall accuracy of 90.55% on the photovoltaic image classification task. For the healthy category, the precision, recall, and F1-score were 90.68%,96.26%, and 93.39%, respectively. For the faulty category, the corresponding values were 90.17%,77.61%, and 83.42%. However, the limitation is that the dataset is not enough and the computation is complex and high-cost. Jaybhaye et al.[17] proposed a deep learning model based on an improved YOLO-FIRI architecture for damage detection and localization in thermographic images of solar panels. The model achieved an overall mAP@0.5 of 0.69, with a mAP@0.5 of 0.64 for single-cell panels and 0.75 for multi-cell panels. The precision and recall were 0.40 and 0.46, respectively. The limitations lie in its limited generalization capability, small dataset size, and high computational complexity.</p></p>

Summary of Existing Researches</p><p>Chapter 3 Methodology</p><p>3.1 Approach</p><p>The proposed model is a hybrid deep learning architecture combining Inception modules, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Attention mechanism to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features from thermal infrared images of solar panels. The architecture is composed of several key components, each playing a specific role in enhancing the model&#39;s performance for solar panel defect detection.<em class='similar'> In the following sections will provide a detailed explanation of each individual module and its function within the overall network architecture.</em></p><p>3.1.1 Inception Module</p><p>Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) extract features by stacking a series of convolutional layers with fixed kernel sizes. However, this fixed-size kernel design may not effectively capture both local and global information simultaneously. Therefore, the Inception network was proposed to address these limitations. The key idea of the Inception module is to use multiple filter sizes (1x1,3x3, and 5x5) instead of just one fixed size, then concatenate them along with the output of the max-pooling layer and pass them</p><p>to the next layer [18]. The defects in the dataset are spatially distributed in an irregular manner, so using different convolution kernels helps extract features more comprehensively.</p><p>The inception module in the proposed model, the first convolution branch uses 1x1 filter size which aims to transform the number of channels quickly and extract local information. Then the second filter size is 3x3, and this branch is used to extract medium-range features. And the third filter size is 5x5, which requires bigger calculation than 3x3 filter size. Next, the pooling layer used to enhance invariance and suppress noise. At last, concatenate these four branches along the channel dimension. In the proposed model, the Inception module takes an input feature map x with a shape of (H, W, C), representing height, width, and the number of channels. It processes the input through four parallel branches:1×1,3×3,5×5 convolutions, and a pooling operation. The outputs from these branches are then concatenated along the channel dimension (axis =-1) to form a new, fused feature map. As a result, the module outputs a wider and more enriched representation, which can be further processed by subsequent layers. Figure 10 shows the inception module in the proposed model.</p><p>Figure 10. The Inception Module of the Proposed Model</p><p>3.1.2 Attention Block</p><p>The Attention Mechanism is a technique that enables neural networks to &quot;selectively&quot; concentrate on the most relevant parts of the input data. In addition, the origin of modern attention mechanisms is commonly credited to developments in the field of natural language processing [19]. This ability to focus on key information allows attention mechanisms to greatly enhance the model&#39;s performance on complex tasks and helps the model identify which parts are more important for the final prediction automatically. For thermal imaging, certain time steps or image features may contain more critical information. Through Attention, the model can automatically identify and focus on these key features. Therefore, the attention mechanism helps improve the model&#39;s prediction accuracy.</p><p>The attention block in the proposed model is a sequential attention mechanism designed to allow the model to automatically focus on the most informative time steps in the sequential input (derived from the BiLSTM output). First, the attention scores are calculated, with an output dimension of (batch size, sequence length,1). These scores are then flattened into a weight distribution and normalized using the softmax activation function, forming a set of weighted coefficients that represent the importance of each time step. Next, the softmax output is reshaped back to the time step dimension of the original input structure. Finally, the attention weights are multiplied with the input features at each time step, highlighting the important time step information. Figure 11 shows the attention block in the proposed model.</p><p>Figure 11. The Attention Block in the Proposed Model</p><p>3.1.3 BiLSTM Module</p><p>Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) is an extension of the traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model, designed to process sequential data. By simultaneously learning features in both the forward and backward directions of the sequence, it is able to capture more information. In addition, BiLSTM uses two LSTM</p><p>networks simultaneously,<em class='similar'> one processing the sequence in the forward direction </em><em class='similar'>(from left to right)</em><em class='similar'> and the other in the backward direction </em><em class='similar'>(from right to left)</em>, this allows the model to capture the relationships and dependencies between previous and subsequent time steps in the sequence. Especially when dealing with data that has long-term dependencies, it can significantly improve the model&#39;s performance.</p><p>The BiLSTM module in the proposed model uses the Reshape Layer to convert the previous feature map into a two-dimensional sequence input suitable for BiLSTM processing. Then, a Bidirectional BiLSTM layer is defined with 64 BiLSTM units, and return sequences equals the True which indicates that the LSTM will return the output at each time step, rather than only the output at the final time step. This allows subsequent layers, such as the Attention mechanism and the fully connected layer, to process the output from each time step. Finally, a Dropout Layer is added to randomly drop 30% of the neurons to prevent overfitting. Figure 12 shows the BiLSTM module in the proposed model.</p><p>Figure 12. The BiLSTM Module in the Proposed Model</p><p>3.1.4 Proposed Model</p><p>Overall, the progress of the proposed model has five steps. The first step is to input an RGB image with the shape (128,128,3). Then the second step is the inception module which is used to extract features. Next, the BiLSTM is used for time series modeling, followed by the fourth step where the Attention mechanism is applied to weight the important features, and finally, after the fully connected layer and output layer, the final output is the probability of the image belonging to each category. Figure 13 shows the structure of the proposed module.</p><p>Figure 13. The Structure of the Proposed Module</p><p>3.1.5 Focal Loss Function</p><p>Focal loss function is a loss function used for binary classification tasks. In addition, focal loss is one of the popular ones in dealing with class imbalance problems as well as improving learning speed [20]. Its purpose is to address the problem of class imbalance, where the model tends to focus too much on the majority class and overlook the minority class during training. In my dataset, the number of defective samples is significantly higher than that of non-defective ones. Traditional binary crossentropy assigns equal importance to each sample, making it difficult for the model to learn from hard examples. Therefore, this model adopts focal loss to mitigate this issue.</p></p>

                    <p><p>The core idea of Focal Loss is to address class imbalance by introducing a modulation factor and class weighting on top of the traditional cross-entropy loss function. It adds a</p><p>modulation factor (1−𝑝𝑡)𝛾 to reduce the loss contribution from easy-to-classify examples, thereby forcing the model to focus more on hard-to-classify samples. At the same time, it introduces a class weight parament 𝛼 assigning higher weights to the minority class (such as non-defective samples), which further enhances the model’s ability to learn from these underrepresented classes. In this way, Focal Loss effectively mitigates the issue of the model being dominated by a large number of easy negative samples during training, and improves the recognition performance on hard and minority class samples.</p><p>In this implementation of focal loss, the predicted output values are first clipped using to avoid numerical instability caused by log(0). Then, the cross-entropy loss for the positive class (i.e., label =1) is computed. To reduce the focus on easily classified samples, a modulation factor is introduced where its value decreases as the prediction becomes more accurate, and increases when the prediction is wrong, thus assigning more weight to hard-to-classify samples. Next, the loss is further adjusted by multiplying with the class weighting factor alpha, which increases attention on the minority class samples (e.g., non-defective class, label =0). The product of these components forms the focal loss for each sample. Finally, a sum is taken along the last dimension to obtain the total loss value for each sample. This process, by modulating difficulty and applying class weights, guides the model to handle class imbalance more effectively.</p><p>3.2 Dataset</p><p>This part will introduce the dataset information include dataset introduction, data separation, data resize and data augmentations.</p><p>3.2.1 Dataset Introduction</p><p>The PV failure detector dataset chosen for this project is the solar cells’ thermal images. This dataset provides 5,352 samples of infrared image of PV panel, categorized into defect solar cell and non-defect solar cell. Each RGB image has a resolution of 640*640 pixels. This dataset, created by the author named E555 Solar Project. In this dataset, an image sample may contain no anomalies, one anomaly label, or multiple anomaly labels. The infrared anomaly labels do not distinguish between temperature anomalies, electrical faults, scratches, damages, etc., and are all uniformly labeled as Thermal Defects. In the annotations, it includes the basic information like filename, path and source. And the image size like width, height and depth. Moreover, the object includes the type name (thermal defect) and other information. In the dataset, the type name is used to judge the status of the solar cell. If the XML file include the ‘thermal defect’, it means this image is defect, and if not include ‘thermal image’, it means there’s no defect in this panel. Figure 14 displays examples of solar cell thermal images.</p><p>Figure 14. Examples of Solar Cell Thermal Images</p><p>3.2.2 Data Separation</p><p>This dataset has 4,733 defective images and 619 non-defective images. In this project, three different partition ratios are used since the sample data shows significant variation. In addition, every set need both the defective images and non-defective images. Different splitting ratios can help avoid overfitting and underfitting, thereby improving the model&#39;s generalization ability.</p><p>The first ratio is 80% for training,10% for validation, and 10% for testing. In this ratio, the training set accounts for 80%, ensuring that the model has more samples for training, allowing it to learn more features. Additionally, there are enough samples in the validation and test sets to evaluate the model&#39;s performance. Figure 15 shows the structure of the dataset split 80:10:10 ratio. Figure 16 shows the class distribution of split 80:10:10.</p><p>Figure 15. The Structure of the Dataset Split 80:10:10 Ratio</p><p>Figure 16. The Class Distribution of Split 80:10:10 Ratio</p><p>The second ratio is 70% for training,20% for validation, and 10% for testing. In this split ratio,20% validation set provides more information to adjust hyperparameters or implement early stopping, helping to avoid overfitting. Figure 17 shows the structure of the dataset split 70:20:10 ratio. Figure 18 shows the class distribution of split 70:20:10.</p><p>Figure 17. The Structure of the Dataset Split 70:20:10 Ratio</p><p>Figure 18. The Class Distribution of Split 70:20:10 Ratio</p><p>The third ratio is 60% for training,20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The proportion of the validation set helps better detect overfitting, ensuring the model&#39;s generalization ability on unseen data. It also provides enough data for tuning and ensures the reliability of the evaluation results with the test set. Figure 19 shows the structure of the dataset split 60:20:20 ratio. Figure 20 shows the class distribution of split 60:20:20.</p><p>Figure 19. The Structure of the Dataset Split 60:20:20 Ratio</p><p>Figure 20. The Class Distribution of Split 60:20:20 Ratio</p><p>3.2.3 Data Resize</p><p>As the introduction mentioned, the image resolution is 640*640 pixels, which does not fit in the proposed model input. And therefore, this project had resized the images of all magnifications into 128*128.</p><p>3.2.4 Data Augmentation</p><p>The data augmentation methods used in this code are part of the ImageDataGenerator class from TensorFlow&#39;s Keras library. These augmentations help improve the model&#39;s generalization ability by artificially increasing the diversity of the training dataset.</p><p>The dataset used in this project is augmented with seven methods. First, rescaling the pixel values of the images to a range of [0,1] by dividing the original pixel values (ranging from 0 to 255) by 255. Second, rotating the image by a degree randomly between -30 and +30 degrees, which helps the model become invariant to slight rotations. Third, shifting the image horizontally by a factor of 0.2(i.e.,20% of the image width) randomly. This helps the model learn to be robust to slight shifts in position. Then, the fourth method is that randomly shifts the image vertically by a factor of 0.2(i.e.,20% of the image height). Like the width shift, it helps with model robustness. In addition, apply shear transformations (shear angle up to 0.2 radians) to the image. This introduces slight distortions, which can make the model more robust to such variations. Moreover, randomly zooming into or out of the image by up to 20%. This introduces variations in scale. At last, randomly flipping the image horizontally, which is particularly useful in tasks where left-right symmetry is present in the dataset (like many image classification tasks). For the validation and test data generators, only rescaling is applied (rescale=1./255), which ensures the images are scaled to the [0,1] range but no other augmentations are applied. This is typically done to ensure that the validation and test sets represent data in its original form. Figure 21 displays the augmentation of the image.</p><p>Figure 21.

Check the dataset sample ratios: the dataset is divided into three different ratios:</p><p>The first ratio is 80% for training,10% for validation, and 10% for testing. The second ratio is 70% for training,20% for validation, and 10% for testing. The third ratio is 60% for training,20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Each of the train, validation, and test sets must contain both defective and non-defective images.</p></p>

Accuracy Curve of Split 80:10:10</p><p>From the training and validation accuracy curves, the training accuracy (blue curve) increases rapidly from the beginning and starts to stabilize after around the 10th epoch, fluctuating between 0.90 and 0.91. Meanwhile, the validation accuracy (orange curve) initially increases slowly, then rises sharply after about the 8th epoch, showing more fluctuation between 0.89 and 0.91. In the end, both training and validation accuracies stabilize around 90%, indicating that the model performs well overall. It effectively learns and generalizes thermal image features of solar cells, and there is no obvious overfitting.</p><p>2. Loss Curve of Split 80:10:10</p><p>Figure 23. Loss Curve of Split 80:10:10</p><p>From the training and validation loss curves, it can be seen that from the 1st to the 50th epoch, both the training loss and validation loss remain at similar levels and steadily decrease. This indicates that the model learns well on the training set and generalizes effectively on the validation set without simply memorizing the data. Additionally, the loss curves are smooth, with no oscillations or sudden spikes, and both training and validation losses eventually converge to around 0.046 to 0.048. This suggests that the loss function converges well, and the model’s output probabilities are very close to the true labels.</p><p>3. Precision and Recall Curve of Split 80:10:10</p><p>Figure 24.

The Inception model also performs excellently, with a rapid rise in AUC during early epochs and a stable plateau later, ranking second in final AUC. The proposed model starts with a relatively lower AUC but shows steady improvement, eventually reaching a comparable level with the Inception model, indicating robust learning capacity. In contrast, the CNN model lags behind, with lower AUC values and a slower increase, suggesting limited representational power.</p><p>4.4.4 F1 Score comparison of four models</p><p>Figure 44. F1 Score comparison of four models</p><p>It’s evident that all models exhibit a rapid increase in F1 score during the first 10 epochs, followed by a plateau. Among them, the Inception + Attention model consistently outperforms the others throughout the training process, achieving higher F1 scores with smaller fluctuations, indicating better stability and generalization ability. in contrast, while the traditional CNN model also improves rapidly in the early epochs, its overall F1 score is slightly lower and shows greater variance, suggesting it is less effective for this task. in conclusion, incorporating an Attention mechanism into the Inception network significantly enhances model performance in classification tasks.</p><p>4.4.5 Confusion Matrix comparison of four models</p><p>Figure 45.

Overall Comparison of four models</p><p>As shown in the results table, the traditional CNN model performs the weakest across all metrics, particularly in terms of AUC (0.9565) and specificity (0.2787), indicating limited capability in distinguishing negative samples under complex conditions. The Inception model shows improved overall performance compared to CNN, with accuracy rising to 90.43% and AUC reaching 0.9651. However, its specificity remains low at 0.2241, suggesting poor recognition of negative cases. The Inception + Attention model, which incorporates attention mechanisms, achieves the best results so far in accuracy (91.93%) and AUC (0.9697), with improvements also seen in the F1-score, demonstrating that attention enhances discriminative ability. Nevertheless, its specificity (0.3442) shows only modest improvement, indicating further enhancement is needed for detecting negative instances.</p><p>The Proposed model, which integrates Inception, attention mechanisms, and a BiLSTM module, takes a significant step forward by combining spatial feature extraction with temporal or contextual learning. While maintaining high precision and recall, it also boosts overall discriminative power (AUC =0.9677) and the ability to recognize negative samples (specificity =0.3519). Compared to using only Inception or attention mechanisms, the addition of BiLSTM enhances the model’s capacity to capture temporal or spatial contextual information, thereby improving its overall classification performance. This makes the Proposed model the most balanced and robust across multiple metrics, especially well-suited for applications requiring high precision in anomaly detection.</p><p>4.5 Model Visualization</p><p><em class='similar'>The goal of Explainable AI is to make AI systems more comprehensible and transparent without sacrificing performance </em>[21].

It then uses the output of one of the convolutional layers of the model along with the predicted gradients to generate a weighted feature map, resulting in a heatmap.

Risk Analysis</p><p>5.3 Professional Issues</p><p>1. Legal Issues: Ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) when using</p><p>thermal images, obtain consent for data usage, and adhere to intellectual property rights. Consider liability concerns if the model&#39;s predictions lead to incorrect maintenance decisions that cause damage to infrastructure.</p><p>2. Social Issues: Automation of maintenance tasks may lead to job displacement for</p><p>workers traditionally involved in inspections. The accessibility of advanced technology should be considered to prevent widening the digital divide, ensuring smaller companies and developing regions can benefit from it.</p><p>3. Ethical Issues: Address biases in deep learning models to ensure fairness and</p><p>accuracy. Ensure transparency and accountability in predictions, and provide explainability of AI decisions. Obtain informed consent from solar plant owners, ensuring they are aware of data usage and analysis.</p><p>4. Environmental Issues: The project promotes sustainability by improving solar panel</p><p>efficiency. However, the energy consumption of deep learning model training and potential electronic waste from AI devices should be considered, ensuring responsible disposal and reducing the environmental footprint of the technology.</p><p>5. Professional Code of Conduct: Follow the BCS and ACM codes, focusing on integrity,</p><p>transparency, privacy, and public welfare. The project must ensure ethical use of AI, safeguard against misuse, and prioritize the welfare of individuals and communities affected by the technology’s deployment.</p><p>Chapter 6 Conclusion</p><p>This research has successfully developed a deep learning model for detecting solar panel defects through thermal infrared imaging. By combining Inception modules, attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM, the model effectively addresses both spatial and temporal feature extraction, which are crucial for identifying the defects of solar cells. The integration of a focal loss function helps overcome class imbalance issues,<em class='similar'> ensuring the model is capable of learning from difficult examples.</em><em class='similar'> The experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms some models like Inception model,</em> Inception + Attention model, and basic CNN model, achieving an accuracy of 91.56%, an AUC of 0.9677, and an F1 score of 95.33%. These results validate the potential of combining advanced deep learning techniques for improved defect detection in solar panels. Furthermore, the use of Grad-CAM for visualizing model decisions enhances its</p><p>interpretability, providing insights into the areas the model focuses on during classification. Despite these promising outcomes, there are some limitations to consider. The dataset used lacks diversity and is relatively small, which may affect the model’s performance when deployed in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the model&#39;s dependency on labeled data for training poses a challenge, especially in large-scale applications where manual annotation is costly and time-consuming. The current model is also computationally expensive, making it less suitable for real-time or large-scale deployment without further optimization. Moreover, the system has not yet been tested in real-time field conditions, such as during drone-based inspections, which limits the understanding of its practical viability.</p><p>In conclusion, this work provides an effective and automated solution for solar panel defect detection, which could significantly improve maintenance efficiency and reduce costs. The integration of explainable AI techniques and practical deployment mechanisms further contributes to the model&#39;s relevance in real-world applications. As renewable energy systems continue to grow, this research holds substantial potential to support the smart operation and maintenance of solar energy infrastructure.</p><p class='uncheck'>References </p><p class='uncheck'>[1] J.
